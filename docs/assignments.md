# Assignment guide

The main assignments for this class all build to one highly-polished op-ed critiquing how an organization or group of organizations is addressing or failing to address climate change. 

These assignments are motivated by the observation that politics is fundamentally an organized activity. Thus, the critiques we develop in this class will target organizations. In your opinion, are they choosing the right battles? Are they taking the right positions? Are they framing the issues in the most effective way? Is their theory of change (or resistance to change) realistic?

Critiquing those with whom we severely disagree is easy, but they are also the least likely to listen to you. Thus, the critiques you develop in this class will be aimed at the organizations you see as having the best chance of making a positive difference in the world---specifically, the organizations for whom you hope to work. You may not know what your future career looks like; that is fine. Perhaps you will find an organization or cause that inspires you in this class. Or perhaps you have a very clear idea of your future career. In that case, this class will challenge you to think about how organizations in your intended field of work engage in politics and policymaking---and how they might do so differently. It is not a requirement that the organizations you address are activist organizations. Indeed, activist organizations may be the most difficult to critique because they already have a well-developed approach to politics and policy. You may even see yourself working for an organization that is currently strongly opposed to most proposed climate policies; that is fine. For example, if you aim to work at Exxon-Mobil, you might look to Business School scholarship to formulate a critique like [this one](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/time_to_put_the_fossil_fuel_industry_into_hospice). 


## Find your voice

In the first third of the class, you develop five op-ed ideas and attempt to write an introduction for each. Along the way, you will identify organizations that you might want to work for (i.e., potential targets for your critique), develop ten possible lines of critique in the form of headlines, and then begin to flesh out five of them by writing the first 200 words of a potential op-ed. 

- Week 2: A list of the top twenty organizations for whom you would like to work and a one-sentence summary of how they engage (or avoid engaging) in climate politics or policy. If the organization has more than 100 employees, specify a unit within the organization.^[Most organizations have an email list---I suggest signing up, both for the assignments in this class and your future career.] 
- Week 3: Ten op-ed-style headlines
- Week 4: Five revised headlines and the first 200 words for each (+ annotated bibliographies, which do not count toward the word limit) 

An annotated bibliography means two things: 

1. Bibliography means that it cites factual claims that are not common knowledge, including the title, author, year, and a hyperlink to the source wherever possible.  References do not count toward the word limit and should be single-spaced. References must be hyperlinked wherever possible. Please try to link to stable public URLs. For journal articles, DOI URLs are best (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1177/1086026619858874), then some other stable repository like JSTOR or the publisher's web page (e.g., https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t5st or https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1086026619858874) if you can't find the DOI URL. I will be checking to ensure that the source is appropriate for an op-ed (i.e., likely to be perceived as legitimate by your audience) and that it supports the claim made in the essay's text. Fabricated sources are unacceptable, and the relationship between claim and evidence is critical.

2. Annotated means that it may include any additional context to help your reader understand why this source is important or why it supports the claim. If these are obvious, there is no need to annotate. Annotation is optional. It allows you to elaborate in ways you cannot in the tight word limit of the main essay. 

I recommend using footnotes or end notes for annotated bibliographies to make it easier for your peer reviewers, myself, and future editors to connect what you say in the essay to the citation. If your op-ed is published, citations will likely take the form of hyperlinks, perhaps with end notes or margin notes for some online publications. 


## Craft your critique 

In the middle third of the semester, you will narrow your focus to three ideas and then two ideas and write the first half of each through multiple rounds of revision.

- Week 6: Three revised headlines and the first 400 words for each + annotated bibliographies
- Week 8: Two revised first 400 words + annotated bibliographies  


## Hone your critique 

Through additional rounds of revision, you will further hone one of your critiques, improving your logic and writing (writing can always be improved). I am mostly grading on how you respond to feedback. If you would like, you can include revision comments on the document in Canvas addressing any points where you feel context is needed for me to understand how you incorporated feedback.

- Week 10: One 750-800 word op-ed + annotated bibliography
- Week 12: Revised op-ed  + annotated bibliography
- Week 14: Final op-ed + annotated bibliography
