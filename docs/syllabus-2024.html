<h1>Course Objectives</h1>
<p>In the past century—the blink of an eye in ecological time—a small portion of humans concentrated in wealthier and more industrialized countries began to radically transform the ecology of our planet at an unprecedented scale.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>This class aims to help you develop your own critique of various policy fights over what to do about our new relationship with our biosphere.</p>
<p>Experts increasingly see the slow policy response to climate science as having less to do with climate science and more to do with politics. That is, climate change is increasingly seen as a problem for the social sciences to address. Thus, this class is about politics. “Politics” can mean many things, and a core objective of this class is understanding different forms of politics—different ways of having and resolving debates about who our community is and what we will do together about the challenges we face. Climate policy debates reflect well-established political and economic perspectives but also raise new, unique issues.</p>
<p>The core readings are mostly drawn from political science, political theory, and law. They are accompanied by op-eds and podcasts from advocates and journalists covering climate policy debates. Both the theories of politics and political arguments cover a wide range of perspectives. We will read a range of critiques based on visions of good politics—from left to right, religious to utilitarian, populist to technocratic—with the aim of recognizing and critiquing these forms of politics when we see them in the wild.</p>
<p>The assignments for this class are motivated by the observation that politics is fundamentally an organized activity. Thus, the critiques we develop in this class will target organizations. In your opinion, are they choosing the right battles? Are they taking the right positions? Are they framing the issues in the most effective way? Is their theory of change (or resistance to change) realistic?</p>
<p>It is easy to critique those with whom we severely disagree, but they are also the least likely to listen to you. Thus, the critiques you develop in this class will be aimed at the organizations you see as having the best chance of making a positive difference in the world—specifically, the organizations for whom you hope to work. You may have no idea what your future career looks like; that is fine. Perhaps you will find an organization or cause that inspires you in this class. Or perhaps you have a very clear idea of your future career. In that case, this class will challenge you to think about how organizations in your intended field of work engage in politics and policy—and how they might do so differently. It is not a requirement that the organizations you address are activist organizations. Indeed, activist organizations may be the most difficult to critique because they already have a well-developed approach to politics and policy. You may even see yourself working for an organization that is currently strongly opposed to most proposed climate policies; that is fine. For example, if you aim to work at Exxon-Mobil, you might look to Business School scholarship to formulate a critique like <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/time_to_put_the_fossil_fuel_industry_into_hospice">this one</a>.</p>
<p>As practice for developing your skills in both effective writing and constructive criticism, peer critiques of your colleagues’ writing are a major part of this class and 15% of your grade.</p>

<h1>Learning environment</h1>
<p>Learning from each other is only possible if we show the respect due to our fellow citizens of this class.</p>
<p>To realize this goal, I expect us to respect our colleagues and cultivate inclusive discussions. This means that we must be careful not to mislead, degrade, interrupt someone who does not speak as much, or enforce hierarchies based on race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender expression, sexual orientation, or ability.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> The Ford School academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. We hold all members of our community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the Ford School promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Plagiarism involves representing the words, ideas, or work of others as one’s own in writing or presentations, and failing to give full and proper credit to the original source. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates academic integrity and ethical standards will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action. The Ford School’s policy of academic integrity can be found in the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wuq2jfmbpflm4f2/FINAL%202023%20Masters%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">MPP</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhllbd4vpfr439r/FINAL%202023%20BA%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">BA</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/06x1tzt1e32pjjw/FINAL%202023%20PHD%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">Ph.D.&nbsp;Program</a> handbooks. Additional information regarding academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct and their consequences is available at <a href="http://www.rackham.umich.edu/current-students/policies/academic-policies/section11#112">U-M’s academic-policies page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Technology:</strong> Students should follow instructions from their instructor as to acceptable use of technology in the classroom, including laptops, in each course. All course materials (including slides, assignments, handouts, pre-recorded lectures, or recordings of class) are to be considered confidential material and are not to be shared in full or part with anyone outside of the course participants. Likewise, your own personal recording (audio or video) of your classes or office hour sessions is allowed only with the express written permission of your instructor. If you wish to post course materials or photographs/videos of classmates or your instructor to third-party sites (e.g., social media), you must first have informed consent. Without explicit permission from the instructor and, in some cases, your classmates, the public distribution or posting of any photos, audio/video recordings, or pre-recordings from class, discussion section, or office hours, even if you have permission to record, is not allowed and could be considered academic misconduct.</p>

<p>You learn by doing work, and I assess your learning by the work you do. You may use tools to help craft your writing, but you must learn the crafts of constructive critique and persuasive writing to succeed in class. To add value to any employer or cause, you must craft arguments and recommendations that are significantly better than they would get by asking a generative text tool. I expect the same.</p>
<p>Text extruded by LLMs is, by construction, derivative of patterns of words already linked together on the internet. In some sense, everything we do is derivative of our experiences, but the generative process is very different for thinking subjects than for a language model. Language models are incapable of producing original critiques. If they produce something that sounds insightful, it is only because we are able to assign meaning to the strings of words they extrude. (It also probably sounds right because it resembles things already written by a human on the internet.) Language models have no sense of meaning and cannot judge the consistency, coherence, or logic of an argument. I expect the critiques you produce to be yours and for you to stand by them as intellectual projects. No LLM can help you justify your thought process and reasoning to me. LLMs have no thought process and do no reason.</p>
<p>I am not yet sure if LLMs are a helpful tool for the craft of persuasive writing or learning this craft. I worry that they may constrain creativity by focusing our attention on problems and solutions that already exist and have already been frequently linked in the source material on which the LLMs are trained. Additionally, in many fields, including political science, rich White men are disproportionately the authors of the source texts. Uncritically using LLMs trained on biased source material risks reinforcing biases.</p>
<p>Good policy and political strategy rests on good evidence. Many LLMs fabricate evidence. Work submitted with <mark>fake sources or made-up facts will get a 0</mark> for similar reasons that other forms of academic dishonesty make your work worse than worthless. The key recommendation of experts studying how students can effectively use LLMs is to craft a solid bibliography first and constrain generative tools to those sources. You will still have to do significant work to make sure that sources are used and cited appropriately, but this is much easier than finding real evidence to replace fake evidence and <em>then</em> making sure it is used and cited correctly.</p>
<p>Thus, <mark><strong>references must be hyperlinked</strong></mark> whenever possible; I will be checking to make sure sources of evidence are used appropriately.</p>
<p>If you use people or tools other than your brain and spelling/grammar checkers to string words together, you should be prepared to comment on what you used it for, what it got right, and what it got wrong.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to discuss your papers in length with you if I have concerns.</p>

<h1>Assignments</h1>
<p>Credit hours will be earned by attending two classes of <span class="math inline">\(1.3\bar{3}\)</span> hours each, reading and preparing written work outside of class for 6 to 9 hours per week, and a series of assignments building to a highly-polished op-ed style critique of an organization’s approach to climate policy. A key part of the process will be critiquing the writing of others.</p>

<section id="week-15-planning-for-change" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-15-planning-for-change">Week 15: Planning for Change</h2>
<!--Learning Objectives
-Understand the basic role of local governments in planning and development. 
- Understand how planners control individuals of individual parcels of land but must constantly deal with broader economic and social forces at work in an urban area.
-Understand different planning approaches:  top-down and bottom-up planning, consensus planning, and centralized and fragmenting budgeting.
-Understand the planning paradox:  making decisions attuned to the interests of existing stakeholders and planning to change the urban area to adapt to changing economic, environmental, and social forces.
-Understand how climate change affects different cities’ environments and economies and, thus, changes the agendas of city governments.
-Understand the linkages between cities and surrounding suburban and rural areas.   How do cities affect the economies of surrounding areas?  How do cities depend on these surrounding areas? How do these surrounding areas (especially suburbs) rely on cities? How do land use changes in surrounding areas lead to changes in cities?  

Adaptation planning 
Learning Objectives
-Explain the meaning of vulnerability, risk, and resilience planning and provide examples
-Differentiate between mitigation and adaptation and how they can relate to each other
-Identify technologies that could help with adaptation and the challenges behind their adaptation.

<p>We will conduct office hours with my door open unless you request otherwise.</p>
<p>Students who wish to have confidential conversations with me may schedule a private meeting via Zoom or may ask to have a closed-door meeting. But this closed-door meeting must be made on your request in writing, even on the spot. I will never suggest a closed-door meeting myself because of the power dynamic.</p>
<p>We will document all pre-scheduled meetings between the instructor and the student via Google Calendar (or other software) and/or university email.</p>
<p>Students who email to request an office hour appointment should expect to receive an email confirmation or a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation from me, or, upon my email confirmation and request, may send me a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation for this meeting. The purpose is to provide a permanent record of the meeting and to ensure that all class activities are documented and transparent. Students who choose to drop by for informal meetings are welcome to do so, but there will be no documentation provided. (See above for open-door policy.)</p>
<p>We will choose meeting locations and conduct meetings with student and instructor safety in mind.</p>
<p>We will ensure that all individual meetings between instructor/student will take place at university venues.</p>
<p>We will ensure that all off-campus meetings, trips, or events must engage with course material.</p>
<p>Off-campus meetings will not involve alcohol or take place at locations that serve alcohol. If the class goes out for a meal, it will be at a cafe or restaurant that does not serve alcohol. The location/day/time of any off-campus meetings between the instructor and students will be documented in Google Calendar (or other software).</p>
<p>We, the instructors, will conduct all individual communications using the University platforms of email, Canvas, Slack, or Piazza, with the caveat that we may use non-university platforms set up by students (such as GroupMe) only if they include all students in the class.</p>
<p>There will be no instructor-student private communications on any non-University platforms, such as social media, GroupMe, WhatsApp, etc.</p>
