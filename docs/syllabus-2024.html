<h1>Course Objectives</h1>
<p>In the past century—the blink of an eye in ecological time—a small portion of humans concentrated wealthier and more industrialized countries began to radically transform the ecology of our planet at a unprecedented scale.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The aim of this class is to help you develop your own critique of various policy fights over what to do about our new relationship with our biosphere. That critique may lead you to suggest a minor change or a transformative one.</p>
<p>Experts increasingly see the slow policy response to climate science as having little to do with climate science and almost everything to do with politics. Climate change is increasingly seen as a problem for social science. Thus, this class is about politics. “Politics” can mean many things and a core objective of this class is understanding different forms of politics—different ways of having and resolving debates about who our community is what we will do together about the challenges we face. Climate policy debates reflect well-established political and economic perspectives, but also raise new, unique issues.</p>
<p>The core readings are mostly drawn from political science, political theory, and law. They are accompanied by op-eds and podcasts from advocates and journalist covering climate policy debates. Both the theories of politics and political arguments explicitly cover a wide range of perspectives. We will read a range of critiques based on visions of good politics—from left to right, religious to utilitarian, populist to technocratic—with the aim of recognizing and critique these visions of politics when we see them in the wild.</p>
<p>The assignments for this class are motivated by the observation that politics is fundamentally an organized activity. Thus, the critiques developed in this class will target organizations. It is easy to critique those with whom we severely disagree, but they are the least likely to listen to you. Thus, your critiques you develop in this class will be aimed at the organizations you see as having the best chance of making a positive difference in the world—specifically, the organizations for whom you hope to work.</p>
<p>As practice for developing your skills in both effective writing and constructive criticism, peer critiques of your collegues’ writing are a major part of this class and 15% of your grade.</p>

<p>Learning from each other is only possible if we show the respect due to our fellow citizens of this class.</p>
<p>To realize this goal, I expect us to respect our colleagues and cultivate inclusive discussions. This means that we must be careful not to mislead, degrade, interrupt someone who does not speak as much, or enforce hierarchies based on race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender expression, sexual orientation, or ability.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Ford School Public Health Protection Policy.</strong> In order to participate in any in-person aspects of this course—including meeting with other students to study or work on a team project—you must follow all the public health safety measures and policies put in place by the State of Michigan, Washtenaw County, the University of Michigan, and the Ford School.

<p><strong>Student Mental Health and Wellbeing.</strong> The University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students. We acknowledge that a variety of issues, both those relating to the pandemic and other issues such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, and depression, can directly impact students’ academic performance and overall wellbeing. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.</p>

<p><strong>Student/Faculty Interaction Best Practices.</strong> We strive to ensure a safe learning environment free from gender-based and sexual harassment, sexual violence, retaliation, and a hostile environment based on discrimination and intimidation. We make the following commitments:</p>
<ul>
<li>To conduct office hours with the door open unless the student requests a closed-door meeting;</li>

<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> The Ford School academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. We hold all members of our community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the Ford School promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Plagiarism involves representing the words, ideas, or work of others as one’s own in writing or presentations, and failing to give full and proper credit to the original source. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates academic integrity and ethical standards will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action. The Ford School’s policy of academic integrity can be found in the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wuq2jfmbpflm4f2/FINAL%202023%20Masters%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">MPP</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhllbd4vpfr439r/FINAL%202023%20BA%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">BA</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/06x1tzt1e32pjjw/FINAL%202023%20PHD%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">PhD Program</a> handbooks. Additional information regarding academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct and their consequences is available at <a href="http://www.rackham.umich.edu/current-students/policies/academic-policies/section11#112">U-M’s academic-policies page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Technology:</strong> Students should follow instructions from their instructor as to acceptable use of technology in the classroom, including laptops, in each course. All course materials (including slides, assignments, handouts, pre-recorded lectures, or recordings of class) are to be considered confidential material and are not to be shared in full or part with anyone outside of the course participants. Likewise, your own personal recording (audio or video) of your classes or office hour sessions is allowed only with the express written permission of your instructor. If you wish to post course materials or photographs/videos of classmates or your instructor to third-party sites (e.g.&nbsp;social media), you must first have informed consent. Without explicit permission from the instructor and in some cases your classmates, the public distribution or posting of any photos, audio/video recordings, or pre-recordings from class, discussion section, or office hours, even if you have permission to record, is not allowed and could be considered academic misconduct.</p>
<p>Please review additional information and policies regarding <a href="https://intranet.fordschool.umich.edu/academic-expectations">academic expectations and resources</a> at the Ford School of Public Policy.</p>
