## 2: The State of U.S. Climate Policy 

> "The hope is that the [Inflation Reduction Act's] bundle of subsidies, tax breaks, infrastructure investment, and market protectionism will unite green-tech boosters with big capital, organized labor, and the beneficiaries of the growth-to-come. If this coalition-building is successful, more green-industrial policy will ensue...Climate is reshaping the terrain on which we will be fighting in the years to come." (Battistoni and Mann)

- End support for water, fuel, or energy efficiency
- Expedite pollution permits and health/safety/cost review^[Directing legal compliance questions to courts (but also reducing judicial oversight?)]
- Expand oil, gas, and mining on public lands

- End international cooperation on climate change
- End environmental justice and cumulative impacts analysis
- Emergency permits for oil and gas projects (e.g., Line 5)

## 4: God and Nature 

The religious, colonial, and mystic foundations of Western environmental law and politics: 


> "The Settlers of the nineteenth-century frontier, clearing and sowing a continental garden, took to heart John Locke's insistence that  "God wants us to do something" and that nature revealed the intended tasks...And for the Romantics who created the Sierra Club, nature's beauty was evidence that awe and admiration, not just usefulness, were parts of the human purpose. God wanted us not just to do something, but also to stand there---and look." (Purdy, p. 199)

## 5: Utilitarianism and Technology 

> "For the conservationists of the Progressive era, managing nature required a combination of civic spirit and administrative expertise." (Purdy, p. 199) 

- How does utilitarian environmentalism differ from other kinds of environmentalism? On what assumptions do utilitarianism and managerialism rest? Under what circumstances are these assumptions more reasonable or less reasonable, in your opinion? 
- What kinds of politics do different technologies create? Who do they empower and disempower? What kinds of policy fights do they inspire?

## 6: Justice  

> People of color [raised] social justice concerns such as self-determination, sovereignty, human rights, social inequality, loss of land base, limited access to natural resources, and disproportionate impacts of environmental hazards and linked them with traditional working-class environmental concerns such as worker rights and worker health and safety to develop an environmental justice agenda. (Taylor, p. 1)

<!--
- What are some of the different ways environmental justice is defined? 
- Where did these ideas come from? 
- How are policies addressing environmental justice consistent or inconsistent with different definitions? 
- How might past environmental justice activism be similar to different to future conflicts in the Anthropocene?

## 7: Ecological Critique  

> "The Wilderness Society is, philosophically, a disclaimer of the biotic arrogance of *homo americanus*." (Leopold, cited in Purdy, p. 192)

> "It is a curious feature of environmental politics...that its rhetorical fidelity to the past can trick an observer into overlooking how innovative it is...In this respect, environmental politics resembles many religious traditions and the constitutional politics of the United States."

## 8: Ecofeminist Critique and Labor

["A Green New Deal for Care: Revaluing the Work of Social and Ecological Reproduction"](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7312/calh20556-005/html?lang=en) / ["Alive in the Sunshine"](https://jacobin.com/2014/01/alive-in-the-sunshine)  by Alyssa Battistoni 

Battistoni asks if it is possible to increase people's quality of life while decreasing our impact on the environment (i.e., producing and consuming less material stuff). She finds answers in the feminist concept of carework. Her argument has many clear policy implications. 

- What is the ecofeminist critique? Specifically, what is the argument about reproductive work? What are the implications of this argument for climate policy? 
- In "A Green New Deal for Care," what does Battistoni mean when she says that "pink-collar jobs are green jobs?" 
- In "Alive in the Sunshine," Battistoni presents two ways of seeing the movement for Payment for Ecosystem Services. What are their ideological roots? What are the implications of each for climate policy? 

> "Capitalism depends on the socially reproductive labor of the household, and by calling that work an act of love, makes it free...As with Wages for Housework, in which the concrete demand for payment acted as a provocative starting point, the demand for payment for work done to and by ecosystems was originally meant as an unsettling metaphor." (Battistoni, *Alive in the Sunshine*)



## 8: Labor and Climate

[Building a Bigger Team: Explaining Organized Labor's Advocacy for Climate Policy in Washington State." by Geoffrey Henderson]() 

- How do incentives to form coalitions and compromise change?
- What does Henderson find regading the importance of mitigating uncertainty? 

[*Carbon Captured: How Business and Labor Control Climate Politics*, Chapter 2: The Logic of Double Representation by Matto Mildenberger](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4620/chapter/211959/The-Logic-of-Double-Representation)

- What is double-representation? 

##  10: Political Economy 

Incumbent industries as a force explaining action and inaction. 

- Why are groups effective at shaping policy? 
- Which industries will lose from which climate policies? Could they pivot?
<!--- Identify examples of “odd bed-fellows”--> 
- What industries have most effectively obstructed policy? How do they work with/against political actors?

The global political economy of climate policy:

 [Why vilify the oil and gas industry? - Emily Atkin](https://heated.world/p/why-vilify-the-oil-and-gas-industry?utm_source=substack&publication_id=2473&post_id=147753396&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share&triggerShare=true&isFreemail=false&r=3m97t&triedRedirect=true)

[Aklin, M. and Mildenberger, M. 2020. “Prisoners of the wrong dilemma: Why distributive conflict, not collective action, characterizes the politics of climate change.” *Global Environmental Politics* 20(4): 4-27.](https://doi.org/10.1162/glep_a_00578)

- Domestic distributive conflict, not international collective action problems explain climate action.

## 11: Indigenous Critique  

[Indigenous Environmental Justice, Renewable Energy Transition, and the Infrastructure of Sovereignty by Kyle Whyte in *Environmental Justice in North America*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003214380-13/indigenous-environmental-justice-renewable-energy-transition-infrastructure-sovereignty-kyle-whyte)

[Andrea Tunks, “Tangata Whenua Ethics and Climate Change”](https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/nzjel1&id=73&collection=journals&index=)


What is the indigenous critique? 
  - In the context of renewable energy siting? 
  - In the context of adaptation?
  - In the context of greenhouse gas emissions? 

How does Whyte distinguish:
  - Reducing harm / injustices to indigenous peoples
  - Indigenous participation/consent
  - Indigenous leadership
  - Self governance
  
Whyte mainly discusses decisions affecting Indigenous lands, while Tunks focuses on Indigenous voices in settler policy processes (including international policymaking). What is the main argument for these two situations?
